Imagine you are really enjoy working with that super expensive Fourier transform
spectrometer you bought 💸, and you want to dive deeper into what's happening and get
out the last bit of information from your data 💾🧑‍🔬.<br>
However, the important steps of data processing are hidden in the ⬛📦 black box of the
device manufacturer's software, and you have no control over them 🤷.<br>

If you are in this situation or you just want to try out something new, you are in the
right place! 💥〰️ `pyftir` 〰️👀 aims to provide an Open Source alternative to
proprietary software. Its algorithms try to reflect the current state of science 🦾.
